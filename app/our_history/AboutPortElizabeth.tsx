          Port Elizabeth, the fifth largest city in South Africa, is situated in
          Algoa Bay on the South Eastern Coast of South Africa, about half-way
          between Cape Town and Durban. It is South Africa&apos;s second oldest
          city and the commercial capital of the Eastern Cape.

        <p className="text-slate-700 text-sm md:text-md">
          In 1820, 4000 British settlers arrived by sea to become the first
          permanent British residents of the area. The first of three commercial
          ships to enter Algoa Bay on the 10th April 1820 was the Chapman. The
          Chapman Hotel is named after this famous British Settler Ship.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 text-sm md:text-md">
          These settlers settled near Grahamstown establishing, what are today,
          South Africaâ€™s oldest parks, newspapers, hotels, churches and pubs. On
          6th June 1820, Sir Rufane Donkin, Acting Governor of the Cape Colony
          at the time, named the city in memory of his late wife, Elizabeth.

          The Anti-Apartheid movement received some of its greatest support in
          the Eastern Cape and many of South Africa&apos;s current political
          leaders call the Eastern Cape home. Nelson Mandela was born, bred and
          educated in the Eastern Cape.

          During the 19th century, Port Elizabeth grew rapidly. This was helped
          by the opening of the railway to Kimberley in 1873. Today, the city is
          home to one of South Africa&apos;s major universities, the Nelson
          Mandela University, as well as being a major African port
          and a manufacturing centre for automobiles.
